## Project Overview 🌟
This project involves analyzing a restaurant dataset to:
- Explore and preprocess data.
- Perform descriptive and geospatial analysis.
- Investigate the impact of table booking, online delivery, and price range on restaurant ratings.
- Build predictive models to forecast restaurant ratings.
- Visualize data to communicate insights effectively.

---

## Dataset 📂
The dataset used in this project contains information about restaurants, including:
- **Restaurant Name**
- **Country Code**
- **City**
- **Cuisines**
- **Average Cost for Two**
- **Currency**
- **Has Table Booking**
- **Has Online Delivery**
- **Price Range**
- **Aggregate Rating**
- **Votes**

---

## Key Tasks 🔍
1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing** 🧹📂
   - Handle missing values and perform data type conversions.
   - Analyze the distribution of the target variable (**Aggregate Rating**).

2. **Descriptive Analysis** 📈📉
   - Calculate basic statistical measures.
   - Explore categorical variables like **Country Code**, **City**, and **Cuisines**.

3. **Geospatial Analysis** 🌍📍
   - Visualize restaurant locations using latitude and longitude.
   - Analyze the distribution of restaurants across cities and countries.

4. **Table Booking and Online Delivery Analysis** 🖥️🍴
   - Determine the percentage of restaurants offering table booking and online delivery.
   - Compare average ratings of restaurants with and without these services.

5. **Price Range Analysis** 💰📊
   - Identify the most common price range among restaurants.
   - Calculate the average rating for each price range.

6. **Predictive Modeling** 🤖📈
   - Build regression models to predict **Aggregate Rating**.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like **MAE**, **RMSE**, and **R²**.

7. **Data Visualization** 📊🎨
   - Create visualizations like histograms, bar plots, and scatter plots.

   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to explore the analysis and models.

---

## Results and Insights 🌟
- **Top Cuisines**: Certain cuisines (e.g., Italian, Chinese) are more popular and tend to receive higher ratings.
- **Location Matters**: Restaurants in specific cities or regions often have higher ratings.
- **Service Impact**: Restaurants offering **table booking** and **online delivery** tend to have better ratings.
- **Price vs. Rating**: Higher price ranges often correlate with higher ratings, but this varies by cuisine and location.

---

## Future Work 🚀
- Explore advanced machine learning techniques like **XGBoost** and **Neural Networks**.
- Incorporate additional data sources, such as customer reviews and social media sentiment.
- Develop a web application to visualize insights interactively.
